The dream behind this was to allow myself to bulk import full URLs as hosts
This check would parse the host address to create a logical check_http command

This script matches simple input:
http(s):// www.address.com :80 /path /ppath.ext?qry=var

scheme hostname port path query
could be extended to use userinfo with -a for check_http
